Convdiff-HDG
============

A program to solve linear convection-diffusion equations by a hybridized discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) finite element method. This is based on the [Step-51 example](https://dealii.org/current/doxygen/deal.II/step_51.html) of the DEAL-II library by Martin Kronbichler and Scott Miller.

The code focuses on solving a fixed PDE but for different types of boundary functions.
