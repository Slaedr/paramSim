ParamSim
========

A set of programs to solve partial differential equations by finite element methods under different parameters. This is based on [DEAL-II library](https://dealii.org) and some example codes from that project.

Some of the example codes used are:
- [Step-51 example](https://dealii.org/current/doxygen/deal.II/step_51.html) by Martin Kronbichler and Scott Miller.

The code focuses on solving a fixed PDE but for different types of parameters, esp. boundary data.
